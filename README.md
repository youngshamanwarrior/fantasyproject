fantasy football project, getting my feet wet
baseline goal is to create a process in which I can somewhat accurately predict the scores of my fantasy football league, and other leagues!

step one is accessing accurate data through API's. 
Step two will be to rewrite simulation in a way where it can mimic the weeks of the fantasy season.
Step three will be to create an app where you can complete this process, as well as include additional features such as :
logging in, having a profile/bet history
moneylines/spreads for the matchups 
mystical matchups (matchup against any team, with spreads/moneylines)
place your actual bet in the app (using tokens that only i have access to give to players
look at other's leagues and bet on their matchups

alot of step three is beyond the scope of the original assignment and will be tackled over the course of a while. eventual goals are to create a website w ads to host all of this on. $$$
